# Lobbying for Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility in US Private Companies

![industry](https://github.com/anaulianova/Climate_Change_Time_Series/blob/main/images/industry.jpg)

## Project Overview

In 2009, 18 different scientific associations issued a perfunctory statement on climate change. It reads, 
**"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver."** Those associations and NASA's publication of their findings can be found [here](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/).

That knowledge isn't surprising now nor was it surprising then nor was it surprising over 100 years ago. As early as the late 1800s, [scientists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/obituaries/eunice-foote-overlooked.html) were proving greenhouse gases warmed the planet. Thankfully, the 21st century has given rise to independent, political and, very rarely, environmentally conscious businesses, encouraging policy reversals and new climate pledges. This project is not aimed at proving something known or castigating governments or corporations. This project is about the future of industry. And money. 

In this changing political and social environment, we felt it prudent to make climate change a financial issue, a means of persuasion for antiquated industries and GHG emitters. By marrying an examination of climate changes and policy, we aim to convince private entities and businesses to mitigate the effects of global warming.

## Findings

### Global Climate Change

![GlobalT](https://github.com/anaulianova/Climate_Change_Time_Series/blob/main/images/globaltemp.png)

Over the 120 years, the mean global temperature has steadily increased. It has spiked dramatically in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as more nations industrialize and material consumption increases. Case in point, China and India now account for close to 40% of GHG [emissions](https://www.activesustainability.com/environment/top-5-most-polluting-countries/).

On a global scale, **"Average global temperatures have increased by 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.2 degrees Celsius, since 1880, with the greatest changes happening in the late 20th century," ([NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/article/climate-change-global-warming-faq.html))

As the planet warms, ice caps melt and sea levels rise:

### Climate Change in the United States 

Per our stated objective, it is certainly one thing to see global temperature changes and another to see how those changes affect the United States and its industries.

Aside from a severe dip in 2008, which was the coolest year of the past decade, the United States has followed the global norm: temperatures are increasing faster and faster, spiking in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. 

Unfortunately, this increase in temperatures is not only found in the heat index, but in severe weather patterns as well: 
![weather](https://github.com/anaulianova/Climate_Change_Time_Series/blob/main/images/monthlyextreme.png)
The following have all been attributed or suspected to come from climate change: 
  - Floods
  - Irregular and more frequent snowstorms 
  - Heavier and stronger hurricanes 
  - Stronger and more frequent forest fires

## Recommendations 

![Biden](https://github.com/anaulianova/Climate_Change_Time_Series/blob/main/images/bidentitle.png)

Here's where the money comes into play.

The Biden-Harrs Administration is pushing an expansive, comprehensive infrastructure and climate change bill. While some of the stated goals, which can be found [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/#:~:text=Today%2C%20President%20Biden%20will%20announce,to%20tackle%20the%20climate%20crisis.), focus on pledges and redoubling America's leadership, much of the bill focuses job creation and the American industry response to climate change. 

Businesses hoping to avoid public ire (see: [Nestle](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/07/coca-cola-pepsi-and-nestle-named-top-plastic-polluters-for-third-year-in-a-row)) and see gains in stock (see: [Jaguar](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jaguar-land-rover-100-electric-104702748.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI-OfLZ6tnMyDnGmC9xY4z2YUcKyQJU0AEMeBj8YQgk0fJl1-NgBSCU3o4JLyU2BVPNJHk5oCdk7mxV3eDX9Y093wF5Vw7RjlmcXOv_aV1BLoeGiypCkPaxDhau6cnsAOJx1jE0XlG7zdx3CBWf8T90LR7_KKbMtyfAkdY48dzeH)), should respond to the climate changes of now in the following ways: 
  - Automative industries should take advantage of the Biden-Harris Administration's pledge to expand the charging network, reducing internal combustion engines and focusing on hybrid/electric vehicles. 
  - Plastic manufacturers should focus on sustainable and compostable packagining to eliminate waste and to meet the changing marketplace, which rewards an investment in sustainability. For help, read the Harvard Business Review's analysis on [green consumerism.](https://hbr.org/2019/07/the-elusive-green-consumer)
  - The energy sector should focus retro and futurefitting their equipment to avoid both the loss of human life from weather occurences and the decrease of economic gains as communities recover.
  - Manufacturing industries across sectors would benefit from working with the Biden-Harris Administration and policy goals. [Moody's Analytics](https://www.economy.com/getlocal?q=C228A0FF-2701-47B2-ADE0-D158B5866251&app=download) found that as many as 2.7 million jobs may be created by the newest infrastructure bill. 

Financial incentives aside, the aforementioned industry and business sectors should address climate change for one simple reason: **there is no planet B, climate change affects us all.**

## Future Work

While there is a vast amount of research on temperature and sea level change, our proposals and models could benefit more from the following: 
1. Updated temperature tracking from federal governments - the most recent compiled data stops at 2015. The same is true for sea level change. 
2. An expansion of GHG data across industries. As of right now, there is not enough GHG data to fine tune models. The UN's data on GHG emissions, as well as the EPA's, only goes back to 1980. 
3. A closer analysis of market fluctations and changes based on climate pledges and green products. While Jaguar saw its stock briefly rise after announcing it would go all electric, that same market information is not widely available for all industries and products. Meaning, as more and more businesses make changes, the amount of information for stock gain/loss is not yet widely available. 
4. Further breakdown of extreme weather events. There is not broad scientific consensus on all the ways climate change affects weather patterns, specifically extreme winter events, (see [the 2021 North America Winter Storm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_13%E2%80%9317,_2021_North_American_winter_storm).
