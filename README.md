### Project Overview

In 2009, 18 different scientific associations issued a perfunctory statement on climate change. It reads, 
**"Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver."** Those associations and NASA's publication of their findings can be found [here](https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/).

That knowledge isn't surprising now nor was it surprising then nor was it surprising over 100 years ago. As early as the late 1800s, [scientists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/obituaries/eunice-foote-overlooked.html) were proving greenhouse gases warmed the planet. Yet, for most of the 20th century, the industrialized world and those in developing nations (China, India, etc.) made few efforts to enact policy mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, giving polluters a rain check on environmental and ethical responsibility. The 21st century, however, has given rise to independent, political and, very rarely, environmentally conscious businesses, encouraging policy reversals and new climate pledges. In this new environment, we felt it prudent to make climate change a financial issue, a means of persuasion for antiquated industries and GHG emitters. 

This project is not aimed at proving something already known n
